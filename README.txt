BLACKVOID
================================================================
Hi there! :)

BLACKVOID is roguelike shooter tower-defense-like Arcade game where you defend your ship and shoot asteroids with challenging difficulty.

The game is made for DragonRuby Classics Jam: Gauntlet Edition game jam, And it takes concepts of shooting and difficulty from Gauntlet, With tower-defense-like Arcade inspired mechanics.

BLACKVOID - GAMEPLAY
================================================================

You play as ship and as the game goal is to protect the ship, You will shoot the asteroids to prevent your ship to crash.

The asteroids come in form of "Waves", And their number increase by each wave as you destroy them to reach each wave (That's what makes it challenging)

Each time you destroy asteroid, Combo increases and it affects your score and gameplay very well as it consists of 2 modes:

1. Normal Mode: The default mode, You lose if you hit by asteroid in case your combo is lower than 2 (1 or 0)
2. Void Mode: The hard mode and designed originally for the game, You lose with any hit whatever combo you have.

So yeah, Enjoy being striked by those asteroids :D

Q: How many levels game has?
A: The game has no levels but "Waves" and it's endless until you lose the game.
